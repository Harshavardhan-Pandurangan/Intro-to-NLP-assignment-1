### Running the code

-   Run the files as described in the assignment pdf itself.
-   For language_model.py, for no smoothing case, use the letter 'n' as the argument, in place of 'g' or 'i'

### Analysis

-   The perplexities for the models range from 2 to 10 for regular model for train and in thousands for test.
-   For good turing it ranges from 5 to 100 for train and in thousands for test.
-   The good turing test perplexities are lower than the regular model test perplexities.
-   For linear interpolation it ranges from 20 to 50 for test set.
